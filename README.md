# FAST

=========================================================================
FAST is a  probabilistic factor analysis method for spatially-aware dimension reduction across multi-section spatial transcriptomics data. `FAST`  is also a package for  analyzing multiple spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) datasets, developed by the Jin Liu's lab. 


We have changed the package name from `FAST` to `ProFAST` as `FAST` is already in use on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org). Therefore, the `FAST` package will no longer be maintained. Please visit [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ProFAST) or [Github](https://github.com/feiyoung/ProFAST) to install the updated package `ProFAST` for your use.
